#Switches to new Feudal contract type, specialized traits and bonuses for liege and councillors based on role.
#Councillors are irrevocable for life unless they are found guilty and refuse arrest.
#Trial for successful arrest, unsuccessful arrest loses their position and they get celtic_excommunication_trait.

#Trial has a variety of outcomes based off of the player's and the accused's traits,
#along with the severity of the crime (assign value system for crimes?).
#Insult poetry slam battle: player interaction for trial. (Bollocks. Find a Poet?)

#Upon making the decision five vassal are chosen as councillors based off of base power, 
#sum of skills, and or traits. Player assigns them to their position.

#Try to make new Round Table window for knights?

#GOIDELIC DECISIONS

#############################################
# #Host Highland Games						#
# by Castor (Charles)						#
#############################################

#Unique tournament where the host is decided by votes from (Goidelic) independant rulers whom are also canidates.

#Upon making the decision the host pays a large sum of money.
#Recieves large amount of prestige, renown, positive opinion, and potential hooks on guests.
#Clan (?) tier realms possibly getting new members.
#Every attendee competes or has a representative competing. Multiple games with rewards for first place.
#Side events such as affairs, cheating, etc. for games.

#This will be difficult. Need to define and reduce.

#############################################
# #Border Raid								#
# by Castor (Charles)						#
#############################################

#Every 2 years Goidelic characters get a unique raid mechanic with their own events and themes.

#Upon declaring a raid: Character interaction, declare goal ranging from pranks to show of force (only available for rivals?).
#Outcomes weighted by relative skills and raid goal. Turned based event system to decide degrees of success. Potentially long.
#Risk of raid escalating or getting out of hand wth consequences to match.

#Need to refine and reduce. Might not be fun.

#############################################
# #Unify Alba and Eire						#
# by Castor (Charles)						#
#############################################

#When Ireland and Scotland are completely ruled by the same dynasty/clan, and they are allied, give option to unify the crowns.
#Forms one of three empires based off of event chain with Scotland and Ireland as de jure kingdoms.

#Great Clan Meeting event chain to argue for best outcome for yourself in the new arrangement. Three Empires:
#Ireland wins, Irish Empire (Hibernia), capital moves to Dublin and switch to feudalism.
#Scotland wins, Scottish Empire (Caledonia), capital moves to Edinburgh and switch to feudalism.
#No one wins or player's choice, Gaelic Empire, capital moves to the Isle of Mann, unique 2 king system (going to be hard).
#Empire is split between 2 kings, wars are put to a vote where voters are powerful clan members.
#Land route from Ulster to Isle of Mann (also doubt this would be possibly. Paradox needs to do this).

#Why Hibernia and Caledonia? Why not a different Gaelic word for each instead of the latin names for them?
#Option three is very likely not possible, need to compromise (kind of ironic), can't have a non-character hold a title.
#Maybe make them both emperors and force them to be allies through something like the Alliance from Guardians of Azeroth.

#############################################
# #Repel the Northmen						#
# by Castor (Charles)						#
#############################################

#Becomes avaiable after being raided five times within five years by Norse or being the victims of varangian adventures twice (needs clarification).
#Get event troops and bonuses against raiders. (Must be Goidelic?)

#Upon decision: If you go 10 years without being successfully raided get 25 year anti-raiding (immunity) buff.
#Get option to build special building (where? Capital?) 'The Iron Keep' which will debuff raiders in the duchy.
